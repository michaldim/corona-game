# Corona-game

Corona-game is a fun JavaScript computer game, with 8 levels. In this game, the user holds a syringe which helps her vaccinate small figures for coronavirus. If she fails, a new variant arrives. The project was written in Vanilla JS ES6 and used [webpack][webpack] to bundle the JavaScript files. It contains [babel][babel], which converts the code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in older browsers. As backend, the project uses Google's [Firestore database and Firebase Auth][Firestore database and Firebase Auth]. Moreover, the game includes animations, local storage for those who don't like to register and it uses Google fonts API.
